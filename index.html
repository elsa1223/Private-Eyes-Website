        <h2>Professional Services</h2>

        <p>There are times when you need confidential information – and it must be fast, reliable and professionally delivered. We have over 35 years of experience providing law firms, financial institutions and insurance companies with a proven and reliable product. Though we are a home-grown San Francisco firm our reach is both national and global through our branch offices and regular attendance at both national and international conferences.</p>

        <p>Our experience pays off. We go beyond ordinary sources of raw data and not only dig deep with both public and proprietary databases, but also use our network of human sources to provide the client with a well-thought-out, analytical report that is concise and detailed. In addition, we still actually talk to regular folk to provide the human intelligence so desperately lacking in today’s fast-paced technologically driven information marketplace.</p>

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h2 class="subheader">Over 60 years combined experience</h2>
        <p><strong>Mary Josepha Nikas</strong> has been a private investigator for over 20 years, both as a manager and as the owner of her own investigative firm. She comes from a background in both the real estate and financial industries prior to entering the investigative industry in 1993. She has an uncanny ability to accumulate and analyze massive amounts of data and produce a concise, detailed report for a winning strategy.</p>

        <p><strong>Seth Derish</strong> is a San Francisco native whose work as a private investigator is internationally recognized. When first licensed in California in 1978 many thought he was the youngest licensed investigator in the state’s history, as at the time he was only 24 years old. He has worked for most major law firms and financial institutions in Northern California and his current clientele spans the globe. If he cannot answer your questions, he will find someone who can.</p>
