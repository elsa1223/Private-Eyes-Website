        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h2 class="subheader">Over 55 years combined experience</h2>
        <p><strong>Mary Josepha Nikas</strong> has been a private investigator for over 15 years, both as a manager and as the owner of her own investigative firm. She comes from a background in both the real estate and financial industries prior to entering the investigative industry in 1993. She has an uncanny ability to accumulate and analyze massive amounts of data and produce a concise, detailed report for a winning strategy.</p>

        <p><strong>Seth Derish</strong> is a San Francisco native whose work as a private investigator is internationally recognized. When first licensed in California in 1978, many thought he was the youngest licensed investigator in the state’s history as at the time he was only 24 years old. He has worked for most major law firms and financial institutions in Northern California and his current clientele spans the globe. If he cannot answer your questions, he will find someone who can.</p>
